# so after messing around with turtle and drawing the geometric series, i found a video about making patterns with lsystems
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ra024-ASY    Im gonna try to take this idea and make something similar in python 

# basically an Lsystem will recursivly iterate a string, like turn x into xxy  and turn y into yxy, and repeat
# x -> xxy -> xxyxxyyxy -> xxyxxyyxyxxyxxyyxyyxyxxyyxy, etc
# we'll do this with an alphabet we make and assign all the characters to a turtles function, and each iteration will follow the instructions represented by our new string
# once we have this all working itll be as easy as swapping some numbers around to make lots and lots of fractals
# btw a fractal is in essence a recurssive shape, so while there are many famous patterns we can try to make, theres probably lots of interesting ones with no name

#this is the function that recieves our seed string and recursivly makes subsequent child strings based on the iter8s and the condition
